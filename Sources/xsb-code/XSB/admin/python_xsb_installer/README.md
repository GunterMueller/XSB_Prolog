# python_xsb_installer

**python_xsb_installer**, is a pure Python installer to
download and install XSB to run under and over, with and without
Python.

XSB
([![XSB-sourceforge](http://xsb.sourceforge.net)](http://xsb.sourceforge.net))
is a next-generation logic programming system with tight connections
that support interleaving Python function calls with Prolog predicate
calls.

While XSB's roots are in Prolog, XSB supports:

- probabilistic and fuzzy deduction,
- stream-oriented deduction
- 3-valued logic, extended datalog with termination assurance
- extremely fast triple compilation (> 200,000 indexed triples per second)

along with dozens of other features.
