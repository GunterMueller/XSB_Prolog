
First ensure that libpython 3 so and the Python.h are installed.

sudo apt-get install python3-dev  
sudo apt-get install libpython3-dev  

If m4/* macros were changed, run

autoreconf -i --install
otherwise, just
autoconf

Then run

configure

===============================================
Sequence of building the py<->xsb connector by the XSB configurator:

1.  build/configure invokes ./configure (in packages/janus/).
    Also builds
        packages/janus/configvars.in --> packages/janus/configvars.sh 
           Sets sh vars to XSB install dir, libdir, emudir, bindir
           Called by ./configure (configure.ac)

2.  ./configure builds many of the necessary connector files. Namely:

        - janus_connect_defs.in --> janus_connect_defs.h 
           #define variables for Python lib dirs/names/includes
           plus #defines for XSB libdirs, emudir, etc.
           #included by janusm.c
        - make_janus_pkg.sh from make_janus_pkg.sh.in
           o creates the setup file for
             the py->xsb connector (called janus/.tmp_janussetup.py)
           o uses janus/.tmp_janussetup.py to make the janus package & install
              it in Python
           o ./janus_mk_setup.P creates janus/janus_activate
             shell file that sets PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH
             WHO calls that???
             PROBABLY NOT NEEDED

           o this is called in step 4 below:
                  invoked by makexsb at the end.
        - janus_info.in --> janus_info.P
           tells XSB if the python interface is configured;
           called by packages/janus.P

3. Then ./configure creates the python janus package by calling
      cd janus
      python .tmp_janussetup.py   (created by ./configure in step 2).
      python -m pip -v install --no-index --find-links=dist janus --user

4. janus/make_janus_pkg.sh,
   which in turn gets called at the end of makexsb.
