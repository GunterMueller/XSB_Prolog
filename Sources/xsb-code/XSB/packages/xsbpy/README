
First ensure that libpython 3 so and the Python.h are installed.

sudo apt-get install python3-dev  
sudo apt-get install libpython3-dev  

If m4/* macros were changed, run

autoreconf -i --install
otherwise, just
autoconf

Then run

configure

===============================================
Sequence of building the py<->xsb connector by the XSB configurator:

1.  build/configure invokes ./configure (in packages/xsbpy/).
    Also builds
        packages/xsbpy/configvars.in --> packages/xsbpy/configvars.sh 
           Sets sh vars to XSB install dir, libdir, emudir, bindir
           Called by ./configure (configure.ac)

2.  ./configure builds many of the necessary connector files. Namely:

        - xsb2py_connect_defs.in --> xsb2py_connect_defs.h 
           #define variables for Python lib dirs/names/includes
           plus #defines for XSB libdirs, emudir, etc.
           #included by xsbpym.c
        - make_px_pkg.sh from make_px_pkg.sh.in
           o creates the setup file for
             the py->xsb connector (called px/.tmp_pxsetup.py)
           o uses px/.tmp_pxsetup.py to make the px package & install
              it in Python
           o ./px_mk_setup.P creates xsbpy/.px_activate
             shell file that sets PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH
             WHO calls that???
             PROBABLY NOT NEEDED

           o this is called in step 4 below:
                  invoked by makexsb at the end.
        - xsbpy_info.in --> xsbpy_info.P
           tells XSB if the python interface is configured;
           called by packages/xsbpy.P

3. Then ./configure creates the python px package by calling
      cd px
      python .tmp_pxsetup.py   (created by ./configure in step 2).
      python -m pip -v install --no-index --find-links=dist px --user

4. xsbpy/make_px_pkg.sh,
   which in turn gets called at the end of makexsb.
